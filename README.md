Project Description
The "Film!" project implements a typical ticket booking service, specifically for a cinema. Users can browse the movie schedule, select a session, and book tickets. The project is built using TypeScript and follows the SPA (Single Page Application) approach, utilizing an API to fetch movie and session data.

Key Features:
Users can book tickets for only one session at a time.
Movie sessions are updated on the server once a day.
When using a mock API, booked tickets remain reserved for 24 hours, displaying occupied seats.
The cart contents are stored in localStorage until the booking is completed.
After a successful booking, contact details are saved in localStorage and auto-filled in the booking form next time.
User Interface Overview
The interface can be divided into three main processes:

Browsing the movie schedule (MainScreen)
Selecting a session and seats (SelectSessionScreen, SelectPlaceScreen)
Placing an order (BasketScreen, OrderScreen, SuccessScreen)
Since the project uses a unified modal window system, its common logic and structure are encapsulated in an abstract class ModalScreen. All modal windows inherit from it and override the necessary methods for specific functionality.

Project Architecture (MVC)
The project follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure:

Model (AppState.ts)
A single application state model (src/components/model/AppState.ts) contains all data logic and actions. Data changes occur through model methods, which notify observers via the onChange(changes: AppStateChanges) method, ensuring decoupled communication between components.

A wrapper, src/components/model/AppStateEmitter.ts, connects the model to the event system.

Controller
Controllers act as event handlers for user actions and update the model state through its methods. The model instance is passed to controllers, which are then injected into top-level views (screens).

View
Top-level screens listen for updates in AppStateEmitter and re-render accordingly. Screens encapsulate implementation details and receive only event handlers and necessary data.

Interaction Flow:
ts
Copy
Edit
const api = new Api(); // API initialization
const app = new ModelEmitter(api); // Model and event system initialization

const screen = new Screen( // Screen initialization
    new Controller( // Controller initialization
        app.model // Passing the model to the controller
    )
);

app.on('change:value', () => {
    screen.value = app.model.value;
});

// Screen.onClick -> Controller.onClick -> Model.value -> Screen.value
This connects all application components efficiently.

View Components
Views are divided into three categories:

Common Components (common)
Independent UI components not tied to project-specific logic.

Partial Components (partial)
Components that implement domain-specific project logic.

Screen Components (screen)
High-level components representing entire screens.

Common (common) and partial (partial) components are independently typed, avoid global settings, and can be reused across projects. Screens (screen) rely on global settings for initialization and data transfer between nested views.

Component Example:
ts
Copy
Edit
class Component extends View<DataType, SettingsType> {
    constructor(public element: HTMLElement, protected readonly settings: Settings) {
        super(element, settings);
        // Avoid overriding the constructor in child components!
    }

    protected init() {
        // Lifecycle method for component initialization
        // Attach event listeners here
    }

    set value(value: number) {
        // Set the "value" field in the UI
    }

    render() {
        // Render the component
        return this.element;
    }
}
If a component needs to use another, it should be passed via settings instead of creating a direct dependency.

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
interface ChildData {
    value: number;
}

interface ComponentData {
    content: ChildData;
}

interface ComponentSettings {
    contentView: IView<ChildData>; // Expecting a view that takes `ChildData`
}

class Component extends View<DataType, SettingsType> {
    set content(data: ChildData) {
        this.settings.contentView.render(data);
        // or this.settings.contentView.value = data.value;
    }
}
To duplicate a component, use the copy() method, which creates a new instance with the same settings (overridable via parameters).

Model
The AppState class represents the project's data model, handling all data logic. It follows an Observer pattern, notifying subscribers of changes via onChange(changes: AppStateChanges).

Basic Model Structure:
ts
Copy
Edit
enum ModelChanges {
    value = 'change:value'
}

interface ModelSettings {
    onChange(changes: ModelChanges): void;
}

class Model {
    constructor(
        protected api: Api, // API for data management
        protected settings: ModelSettings // Settings and event handlers
    ) {
        // Model initialization
    }

    public changeValue(value: number) {
        // Modify data
        this.onChange(ModelChanges.value);
    }
}
Controller
Controllers handle user interactions and update the model state through its methods.

Example Controller:
ts
Copy
Edit
class Controller {
    constructor(
        protected model: Model // Model instance
    ) {
        // Controller initialization
    }

    public onClick = () => { // Preserve `this` context
        this.model.changeValue(1);
    }
}
Controllers primarily manage event handling and decision-making, while models handle data dependencies. This separation ensures flexibility.

Final Thoughts
The Model encapsulates business logic and data management.
Controllers act as intermediaries between the Model and the View.
Views manage UI rendering and user interactions.
The project adheres to modular development principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
This approach allows for clear separation of concerns, making it easier to expand and refactor the project in the future. ðŸš€
